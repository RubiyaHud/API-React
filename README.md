# API (Application Programming Interface) 
### "An **API** is a **set of rules** that lets different apps or programs talk to each other and share information safely and easily."
In simple Restaurant and Waiter example:

The **API** is like a waiter that takes the request from customer to the kitchen and brings back the result, without needing to know how everything works inside.

## Postman
"Postman is a **digital toolkit** that helps developers explore, test, and share APIs—like a powerful remote control that lets you send requests to any API and instantly see how it responds, without needing to write a full program."
### What Postman does in the context of APIs:

### How to use it:
- Go to the link [Download Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/). Download the app to get started with the Postman API Platform
- Install Postman App in the system
- Open the App, then click "Send an API request"
- Select a method such as **GET**

- Copy [the Country API](https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all), then Paste it inside the **GET**, then click **Send** button

- The successful **Get Request** will fetch the data properly

- Now we can check "Does the API provide Valid data", "Does the Data work or Not" and, also we can search some specific Data.

## Thunder Client extension in VS Code
"Thunder Client is a lightweight API testing tool built right into VS Code, letting developers send and test API requests without ever leaving their code editor—like having a mini Postman quietly sitting inside your workspace, ready to test APIs with speed and simplicity."










## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
