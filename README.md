# API (Application Programming Interface) 
### **"An API is a set of rules that lets different apps or programs talk to each other and share information safely and easily."**
In simple **Restaurant and waiter** example:

The **API** is like a waiter that takes the request from customer to the kitchen and brings back the result, without needing to know how everything works inside.

## Postman
"Postman is a digital toolkit that helps developers explore, test, and share APIsâ€”like a powerful remote control that lets you send requests to any API and instantly see how it responds, without needing to write a full program."
### What Postman does in the context of APIs:

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
